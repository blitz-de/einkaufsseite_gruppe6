#1 App.js

The whole backend application is based here and all other modules
and classed will be required/imported to this class. 

a. creating an express app by requiring express and creating a const app

b. imporing the database using mongoose

c. using all the necessary middlewares using external module
    -morgan: HTTP request to simplify the process of logging requests to our app. It saves time  by generating request logs
    -bodyParser: 
        * it extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.
        * It parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request. 
                 
    -cookieParse: 
        * to parse cookie header and populate req. Cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.
        * I can also pass a secret string, which assigns req.
    -expressValidator:
        * a set of express middlewares that wraps validator.js validator and sanitizer functions.
        * It can be used to incorporate in our app for server-side data validation
    -cors: to make the bridge between front- and backend

d. using the routes in our backend after requiring them
    -authRoutes: 
    -userRoutes: 
    -categoryRoutes:
    -productRoutes:

Eventually, set a default port that we want to hear from and allow
the possibility to enter another port throught the .env file located in the backend file.

# .env
DATABASE=mongodb://localhost/ecommerce
PORT=8000
